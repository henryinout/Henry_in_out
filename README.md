## 📂 Repository Structure

### 1. `Tournament_Algorithm` (Project: Phigros Master Tournament)
> *Referenced in "Additional Information" & "Supplementary Essay"*

* **Context:** Algorithmic solution for fairness in a large-scale (300+ participants) rhythm game tournament.
* **Key Files:**
    * `ModiElo.cpp`: Implementation of the modified **Elo Rating System** adapted for 4-player matches.
    * `scheduling_logic.py`: Utilization of **Buchholz Score** to prevent repetitive matchups.
* **Impact:** This system successfully managed the "Phigros Master Tournament," ensuring mathematical fairness in a chaotic environment.

### 2. `Research_Optimization` (Computational Geometry & Combinatorics)
> *Referenced in Activity List: "Research in Computational Geometry"*

* **Projects:**
    * **Akari Solver:** Source code for "Optimization by Analogy w/ Art Gallery Problem." Implements triangulation and iteration methods.
    * **Set Cover & FPP:** Python implementation of the **Integer Linear Programming (ILP)** model used in my "Football Lottery Profit Strategy" paper.
* **Note:** These scripts demonstrate the computational verification of the theoretical models discussed in my research papers.

### 3. `Math_Foundations` (Self-Study Notes)
> *Referenced in "Why Major" Essay*

* **Content:** Detailed LaTeX notes from my self-study of **Set Theory** and **Model Theory**.
* **Highlight:** Please see `Section_3_LST.pdf` for my derivation and philosophical commentary on the **Löwenheim-Skolem Theorem**, which directly inspired my personal statement regarding "relativistic truth."
* **Format:** Compiled PDF + `.tex` source files.

### 4. `Puzzle_Design` (Malody & Logic Puzzles)
> *Referenced in "CMU Community" Essay*

* **Context:** A portfolio of logic puzzles designed for the Malody community, integrating music theory with cryptography.
* **Contents:**
    * `Design_Notes.md`: A breakdown of the logic construction behind the puzzles.
    * `Solution_S1.pdf`: Walkthrough for Section 1 of the Christmas Event.
* **Goal:** To demonstrate how abstract structural logic can be gamified for community engagement.

## 🧩 A Challenge for the Reader

> *"Mathematics does not need to be forced upon the world... it serves as the quiet, invisible scaffolding."*

I have hidden a small, logic-based "Easter Egg" within the `Welcome` directory of this repository. It is a simple tribute to the joy of discovery.

* **Hint:** The key relates to the year non-Euclidean geometry was independently discovered (as mentioned in my essay).
* **Status:** *Waiting to be solved.*
