## 🧩 A Challenge for the Reader

> *"Mathematics does not need to be forced upon the world... it serves as the quiet, invisible scaffolding."*

I have hidden a small, logic-based "Easter Egg" within the `Welcome` directory of this repository. It is a simple tribute to the joy of discovery.

* **Hint:** The key relates to the year non-Euclidean geometry was independently discovered (as mentioned in my essay).
* **Status:** *Waiting to be solved.*
